## :speech_balloon: Project Summary

Northcoders News (NC-News) is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Users can access articles which can be divided by topic or sorted by various criteria. Each article has user ratings which can be up or down voted using the API. When logged in, users can also add/delete comments about an article.

This project was created over two weeks on the Northcoders Coding Bootcamp. The first week was dedicated to building a RESTful API using Express.js with PostgreSQL; the second week focused on the front end working with REACT.js.
